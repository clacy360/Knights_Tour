# Knights_Tour
This program accomplishes the Knight's tour with recursion. The Knight's tour solves the problem if the knight piece in chess can travel to every location on an 8x8 chess board without ever landing on a square more than once. The user does not input any data, and the output data(completed chessboard) is sent to the screen.

Disclaimer: Although I created this solution, this project was not my original idea. It was a school project for Everett Community College related coursework.
